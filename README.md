## Overview

The Puzzle RANSAC project is a computer vision application that aims to solve jigsaw puzzles automatically using the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm. By analyzing the puzzle pieces, their shapes, and matching their edges, the project provides an efficient and accurate solution for assembling jigsaw puzzles.

## Key Features

- Jigsaw puzzle solver: Automatically solves jigsaw puzzles by identifying piece orientations and arranging them to form the complete puzzle.
- Affine and Homography transformations: Supports both affine and homography transformations to handle different types of puzzles.
- Feature matching: Utilizes feature detection and matching techniques to accurately align puzzle pieces based on their edges and shapes.
- RANSAC algorithm: Implements the RANSAC algorithm for robust estimation and filtering of noisy matches.
- Configurable parameters: Allows customization of parameters such as RANSAC threshold, iteration count, and matching ratios for optimal puzzle solving.
